# Online Library System

This repository contains my **first Java project**, developed as part of my learning journey in object-oriented programming (OOP).  
The goal of this project is to simulate a simple **online library system** that manages books, members, and loans.

## Project Overview

The **Online Library System** allows basic library operations such as:
- Registering and listing books   
- Managing library members   
- Handling book loans and returns   
- Keeping track of borrowed items
